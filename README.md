# Rickroll-Wifi 

[![Code Review](http://www.zomis.net/codereview/shield/?qid=131588)](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/131588)

A ESP8266 script to rickroll people. Creates an AP with a different name every 5 seconds with strings specified (By default, lyrics of Rick Astley's Never Gonna Let You Down). Not necessarily for rickrolling as you can use it to advertise products or to do a PSA.
